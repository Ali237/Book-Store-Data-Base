# Bookstore Database

This project is a simple bookstore database implemented using Python and SQLite. It features both a command-line interface and a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Tools Used

    - Python
    - SQLite

## Overview

This bookstore database project provides two main options for interacting with the data:

    Command-Line Interface (CLI): A functional and fully operational command-line based interface for managing the bookstore database.
    Graphical User Interface (GUI): An under-development graphical interface for a more user-friendly experience.

## Setup

To get the best experience and view of the database tables, it's recommended to install the SQLite extension on Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
How to Use
Command-Line Interface

The command-line interface is fully operational and can be used to manage the bookstore database. The script for the CLI is named DataBase_command_line_based.py.

To run the CLI:

*bash*

```python3 DataBase_command_line_based.py```

Graphical User Interface

The GUI is still under development and review. Once completed, it will provide a more intuitive and user-friendly way to interact with the database. The script for the GUI is named DataBase_GUI.py.

To run the GUI (note that it is currently a work in progress):

*bash*

```python3 DataBase_GUI.py```

### Future Improvements

    Complete the development and testing of the GUI.
    Add more features to both the CLI and GUI based on user feedback.
